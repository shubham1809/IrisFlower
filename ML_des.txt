1.machine learnig model of iris flower data set

as of now we have seen what is machine learning and its detail.
now we are going practical implementation of one simple & best ML model for iris flower dataset.

Ml model is nothing it is just mathematical function which will give some numeric inputs and gve numeric out puts.
Data will be always numeric here because machine can understand data only .


steps to make ml model
--------------------------------------
1.load the dataset
2.analyse the data set
3.prepare the data(remove unwanted data,fill blank value,converion etc)
4.split the data into train and training dataset
5.Build and Evaluating the Model's Accuracy
6.save the model and test for live data


Keywods
-----------
1.input dataset is called attribute or features
2.output is called label/target

This is supervised classified model becuase here target value is present


classified --discrete
regression -continous


iris flower dataset
-----------------------------

attributes

sepal length
sepal width
petal length
petal width


python is ismple to write code and give various library for development of model.
numpy,pand,matplotlib,scikit learn are most popular library is used in ml model.
